# Mobile-Attendance-Application

A Mobile Attendance Application has been built to eliminate the time and effort wasted in taking attendances in schools. It also greatly reduces the amount of paper resources needed in attendance data management. It is built to be used by faculty, so that they may take student attendance on there phones.
